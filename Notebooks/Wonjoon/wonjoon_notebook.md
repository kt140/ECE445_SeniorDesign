# 2022-02-08 to 2022-02-10  Project Proposal <a name= "Firstmeeting"></a>
We had our first TA meeting Feb 8th to get our project proposal draft checked out. While the project proposal served to present general project idea to the TAs and the faculty, it helped us to sort out general design approaches and set priority goals. One concern we brought up to the TA during this phase was usage of the ECEB solar panel. Buying solar power that is small sized, but capable least 10W is quite expensive in the market. Since our project goal is to output 10W, having an access to ECEB solar panel (on the sunny days, using only small part of it can harvest around 80W) will be extremely beneficial. 

# 2021-02-16 MCU Board Research <a name= "keyboard1"></a>
As indicated on the project proposal, potential microcontroller candidates are ATMEGA2560 and ATMEGA328. ATMEGA328 will be preferable if it can support all the peripherals we require.

I decided to add some of open source kicad parts to complement our PCB design. 

Here are the links to their github:
