## 02-24-2022 - Completed simulations for Design Document

Utilized LTSpice to simulate our Buck converter that is being cascaded together with our Buck-Boost converter. During this time, I was able to simulate how the duty cycle affects our overall output ripple voltage. This allows us to essentially control and utilize. 

We can see this simulation result from the images below:

Points to note with these are that
