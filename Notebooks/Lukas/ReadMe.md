## Solution Components:
1. Input: Solar Panel Power Voltage Input (Solar Panels)

    1. Cost effective, efficient, and portable
    2. Commercially available solar panels on digikey are only rated at 1-2 [W], would need to create an array of solar panels to reach 10 [W] on output side
   
2. Synchronous Buck/Boost Converter

    1. Control schema to regulate the power being extracted from the solar panel
    2. Microprocessor creates duty cycle to regulate the intermediate voltage potential in the energy storage unit. The actual energy storage unit will be an off the counter mobile power bank to reduce complexity of a self designed battery.
   
 1. Design of energy transfer process

    1. Need for appropriate voltage regulators to quantify the amount of power received from the solar panel
    2. Current Transducer (CT) and/or regular current sensors can be utilized to monitor that output and the calculations of power consumption will be done on our MCU.
    3. We can store our energy within a small scale power bank (over-the-self portable power bank) that should allow us to keep reserves of the energy.
    4. Stable intermediate voltage potesntial using a custom designed micro controller unit.
3. Secondary DC-DC Converter for several outputs
    1. Use of transformers to provide several different output potential voltages
    2. Analog USB power supply design
   
4. Output: Distribution of different voltage potentials for charging.
    1. Using the rechargeable batteries ordered, we will ensure the output potentials are restricted to the recommended current for charging.


# 01/31/2022 - Researching DC-DC topologies and Battery Safety Precautions <a name="projectproosal"></a>
The current implementation I suggested is the Forward or flyback Converter, which uses a three winding transformer to deliver power from the primary winding to the secondary output windings. A picture of the converter can be seen below, wehre the transformer provides galvanic isolatioon between the input and output. This would be ideal to use in our project, because it clearly separates the USB 5V/2A from the NiCd 1.6V/70mA. A downside of this approach is that the solar panel input has a direct path to the output, where MPPT may deliver more power then the load can handle. Furthermore, the closed loop control loop with feedback would have to monitor all three windings of the transformer, which would increase the complexity of the software implementation. 

My idea outlined in the RFA includes several batteries that must store some charge. A consumer product needs to regulate a battery to store excess energy, as well as the USB charging protocol and NiCd batteries. The course policy on battery safety has been reviewd by each of my team members, and the associated signature agreement is located in this GitHub. We plan on limiting the total current, implementing fault protection, and reverse polarity detection on each battery, to ensure there is no safety concerns or misconduct according to IEEE guidelines. 

# 02/03/2022 - Research on MPPT <a name="projectproosal"></a>

I have looked into several different algorithms that can be used to obtain the maximum power point. The ones we will be able to implement are Peturb and Observe, Incremental Conduction, or Ripple Correlation. Ripple correlation is used for DC-AC applications, where as the other two can be used to power a DC DC converter. Peturb and Observe operates by making small changes to the duty cycle, and oberserving the change in output power. If the change in the duty cycle caused more power to be consumed, the duty cycle is incremented, otherwise it is decremented. What is convenient about this algorithm is that we can measure the current through the inductor in a closed loop feedback. The last algorithm we can use is the Incremental Conduction Algorithm, which is similar to Peturb and Obsevre, but involves computing the $\frac{dI}{dV}=0$, in order to ensure we converge to the maximum power point. It is more computationally expensive then the Peturb and Observe with slower convergence, but it minimizes unwanted oscillations at the output. Hence, picking the appropriate algorithm is a tradeoff beteween simplicity versus accuracy.

# 02/6/2022 - Begin Working on Project Proposal<a name="projectproosal"></a>

After looking at the rubric for the Project Proposal, I began working on an outline of different subsystems and the tolerance analysis. The primary focus was doing simulations of a Forward conevrter, which can be found in the directory "Not uploaded lol." Thee LTSpice simulations shows a normal forward converter where the user must enter the specifgied input voltage and the target duty cycle. After assigning values to the capacitors, switches, and transformer, I was able to acieve a working topology that delivers the correct amopunt of pweor to both of the output terminals. One downside I noticed is that the two output voltages are coupled together,  meaning any peturbation in the duty cycle affects both voltages. If we were to apply a closed loop control algorithm, where we measure the current and adjust the duty cycle, we would not be able to individually control either output. This is a large problem with our current design, and is further addressed in the Tolerance Analysis. 

This problem can be solved by modifying the MPPT algorithm to supply the maximum allowed power, by setting an upper bound on the output solar panel current. This upper bound restricts the current on the primary winding of our transformer, which is mathematically represented as ùêº . Thus, if we can place an upper bound in by $I_1N_1 + I_2N_2 + I_3N_3 = 0$
programming the microcontroller, then there will also be an upper bound on the sum of the output currents on $I_1$, and the total output current $I_2 + I_3$ does not exceed any ratings. Furthermore, in the no load conditions when $I_2 = 0$ and $I_3 = 0$, we can focus on providing a path for the current ùêº to the charge storage unit. This is the strength of using a three winding transformer in $I_1$ our design, but we must also be prepared to account for additional losses, such as the magnetizing inductance of the system.



# 02/08/2022 - First TA Meeting <a name="projectproposal"></a>

The first TA meeting was mainly to demonstrate that our notebooks, were all in one repository on GitLab. The project has several circuits, such as Li-Ion battery charging, that we have not had experience designing. We further discussed the need for software in the project, where we must select an appropritate MCU. After speakign with Professor Schuh, he reccomended that we use an ATMEGA328P, rather then an entire Arduino Uno. This works well for us, since I have expereince with the Arduino IDE. We then set our weekly meeting time to 2 PM on Fridays. 

# 02/13/2022 - Solar Panel Research <a name="designdoccheck"></a>
One thing that is still ambiguous for our project, is how we will test our device using a photovoltaic power source. The cost of solar panels is larger then our budget, where we cannot afford a compact solar array with a maximum output of 15-20 W. One idea I discussed with Kanin is using the solar panel attatched to a single bench in the lab, rather then pluggin our device directly into the terminals. This is how we both worked with solar panels in the Power Lab, but the solar panel in the Senior Design Lab is cluttered with old projects. We do not feel comfortable disassembling wires from teams that have not cleaned up after themselves. I emailed Professor Schuh for his suggestion on the best course of action, but he has not emailed me back. 


# 02/15/2022 - Purchased ATMEGA328P as the MCU <a name="designdoccheck"></a>
Today, I went to the ECE Supply shop and bought an ATMEGA329P MCU before they went out of stock. Many microcontrollers are not available online due to the supply shortage, so I paid the cost out of pocket to secure the part in our design. The next step is figuring out how we will program the MCU while it is assembled on the final version. 

# 02/18/2022 - Second TA Meeting <a name="designdoccheck"></a>
After we were able to put more thought into each subsystem of the project, such as the current and voltage regulation, input power manmagement, etc., the main task was to finish securing the details of each circuit. We have several deadlines in the course, including the soldering assignment and our DDC, so we discussed each of our responsibilities for the following week. I began writing the Design document while looking over the power electronics needed, Wonjoon would help designing the circuits needed to interface with the MCU, and Kanin would help simulate and design the power converter. 

# 02/20/2022 - Solar Panel Inspection <a name="designdoccheck"></a>
Today, I visited the lab to verify the solar panel we had access to. I needed to look at the rated power and standard operating conditions of the solar panel, such that we could finalize the input specifications to our DC DC converter. This can be seen in the image below, where all of the key parameters are listed. We should further note that we will not be able to dissipate 100 W of power, thus we have to include some kind of large energy storage unit or limit the amount of power we can harness from the solar panel. The latter is the better option, where we can simply cover a fraction of the solar panel with some anti reflective coating or shade. We do not expect to dissipate over 20 W of power in our project, which would allows us to eliminate $\frac{4}{5}$ of the solar cells  ( $P_{max}/5  = 20 \ W$ ). Further research needs to be done on the solar panels data shee, in order to know exactly what area needs to be shaded. One tradeoff of this method is that we will no longer be able to use the parameters listed in the image below, because they are meant to describe the entire solar array. We will have to do furhter testing with the solar panel, to redefine $V_{OC}$, $I_{SC}$, and $P_{MAX}$ with 1/5 of the solar array. The second image shows a detail image of the solar panels connectors, which we need to find the appropriate electrical connection for.

# 02/21/2022 - Design Document Check <a name="designdoccheck"></a>
The design document went well today, which allowed us to receive good feedback about our Tolerance Analysis. Originally, we mentioned some of the challenges we might run into using different DC DC converter topologies. The DC DC power subsytem is the centerpiece of our project, but we have been struggling to develop it in detail because we do not have access to the necessary software, such as MATLAB and SIMULINK packages. We further were naive and expected to buiy a small solar array that could be incorporated into the final consumer design, but solar panels are quite expensive during the supply shortage. We would need to spend $80 to reach 16 W of power. Although we proposed possible solutions and research in different algorithms, we were told that we should work through the math of a criticial subsytem, and that simply putting the equations was not enough. Kanin and I then began simulating a Buck and a Buck Boost, the main two choices we were consdiering in our design topology, in LTSPice, using the corner points of the Renogy Solar Panel. We used a python script to simulate different duty cycles, where the cascaded DC DC converter could reliable create a 5-7 V Power Signal. 

We have also decided to change the DC DC converter used in our project. We have been looking at doing a cascaded converter, instead of a Flyback converter, because we need to regulate both the input and output voltages. Our idea is that we can use the MPPT algorithm to extract the maximum power from the solar panel, and then have a second DC-DC converter in series. The secondary DC-DC converter would have a control algorithm wrapped around it, which restricts the output to 5V regardless of the input. The two most common converters used are a Buck-Boost or a Boost-Buck, which both can be characterized by the formula $V_{out} = \frac{DV_{in}}{1-D}$. This 




# 02/22/2022 - Design Document Submission #1 <a name="designdoc"></a>
I began working on a design document in latex and in google docs. Thwe google docs was meant to be a quick place where we could collaborate ideas, and then the final edited versions can be transferred to Latex. Today I was able to write the Introduction and part of the MPPT subsytem and related circuits. Furthermore, I began to sketch an image for the conceptual design of the project. I will add that image here once I am finished. 

![](images_markdown/Consumer_Design.jpg)

# 02/23/2022 - Design Document Submission #1 <a name="designdoc"></a>

Continued working on the design document as a team. There were several moving parts to each subsytem, and we mainly worked together to understand how each piece fit together. This further allowed us to share all of the resdults we had found, making sure everyone was up to date on the project. One thing that is a point of problem, is that we are still unable to simulate our MPPT algorithm and do not have time to develop robust code in c/c++ to test any algorithms ourselves. We have mainly been loking at research papers, [like this one](https://github.com/kt140/ECE445_SeniorDesign/blob/main/Notebooks/Lukas/Resources/MPPT-and-optimal-Li-ion.pdf "like this one").


# 02/25/2022 - Weekly TA Meeting <a name="designdoc"></a>

During this weeks TA meeting, we discussed how much progress we have made before the PCB Check next week. Our group has made significant headway on the MCU and NiCD Battery charging subsystems, in part thanks to Wonjoon developing the MCU PCB. For my side of things, I am very behind designing the power board PCB, because we have not finished selecting the parts, such as current sensors, gate drivers, and control ICs. Many of the most suitbale parts are not in stock do to the supply and manufacturing shortage, so we have been scouring the internet that have different ICs to do unit tasks within our design. Once these components have been selected and more simulation has been done to compute the maximum current and voltages through our pwoer electronics, we can begin routing the PCB. We will be able to turn a PCB for the PCB Review, but we will not have our entire project designed and implemented. This is also in part due to exams in my other classes, on top of writing assignments for this course. 

# 02/28/2022 - Heat Sink Considerations <a name="designdoc"></a>

From prevoious experienec in Power Electronics, the MOSFETs are non-ideal devices with both conduction and switching losses. We are using the [IRLB8721PbF](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irlb8721pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a40153566056732591 "IRLB8721PbF") as the power MOSFETS for our DC-DC converter, which have a maxuimum temperature range of 175 Celsius. We also expect several amps of current to flow through these MOSFETS, where the conduction losses are $P_{cond} = i_{ds}^2 R_{ds}$. The switching losses are due to the finite transtiion times for the MOSFET to change states, which is further discussed [in MOSSFET Losses](https://powerece469.web.illinois.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/70-41484.pdf "in MOSSFET Losses"). With this in mind, we have decided to implement a heat sink in our final project, to ensure that we do not exceed the maximum temperature of the devices whens everal watts of power are coming off of the solar panel. We intend to use a heat sink for all of our voltage regulators and switching converters, due to the high currents that can come from the solar panel. The images from [Renewable Energy Innovation](https://www.re-innovation.co.uk/docs/heatsink-calculations/ "Renewable Energy Innovation") shown below illustrate why a heat sink is needed, because it provides an additional layer of thermal resistance when the device is dissipating heat.


![](images_markdown/Heatsink.PNG)

We already have access to heat sinks that can be directly attatached to the back of a through hold MOSFET our LDO voltage regulator. The following image shows the absoluate minimum clearance widths for ourt powr PCB, in order to succesfully attach this to the back of each device. We should do further simulations of how much power we expect the DC=DC converter to dissipate, such that we can reduce the overall volume of the heatsinks. 

![](images_markdown/HS-dimensions.PNG)

# 03/01/2022 - PCB Review <a name="designdoc"></a>

The PCB review went well for us as a team, there were no major complaints from either of the TAs. We only presented the MCU board, because the MPPT Power PCB will not be finished by the first order deadline on 3/8. Both Yei and I who are responsible for developing the power converter have two midterms this week, and have not had a chance to consistently work on 445. Our goal is to order as many parts as possibel first, and try to finish the second PCB by the end of spring break. The second TA approved of our idea of using a heat sink on the power board, due to the large amount of current we expect to draw from the solar panel. 


# 03/02/2022 - Design Document Review <a name="designdoc"></a>

The Design Review went alright, but we seem to have presented too much content. We ran out of time to recieve meaningful feedback, but the professor did ask us "What do you plan on doing for curtailment or when there is no load connected to the solar panel?" This was the biggest technical detail that we forgot to include in the Design Document, where we chose to simplify our project by elimintating the need for an energy storage unit. We did not want to design three different PCBs to handle different battery inputs, and believed this to be outside of the scope of what can be accomplisehd within a semester. We did mention a larger charge storage unit in our RFA and our Project Proposal that would handle the curtailment of the soalr panel, but chose to focus our project on MPPT and USB charging. The biggest take away from the design review is that we need to rehearse the final presentation better, give a more breoad overview of each subsystem, and focus on our results rather then each subsystem design. 


# 03/02/2022 - Setting up Overleaf for Final Report <a name="designdoc"></a>

After we struggled to ensure consistent formatting on the Design Document, we are going to move to Latex for future written assignments. This can be included in the 'textbook cost' of the course, since we must pay $7.99 to share a document with three collaborators. I signed up for the student account subscription, and began organizing a folder stored on the cloud for each team member to access. Here is the link to the shared overleaf document for the [final report](https://www.overleaf.com/project/6212a237c2cf8f5ac891d9d0 "final report").


# 03/04/2022 - Weekly TA Meeting  <a name="designdoc"></a>
The main discussion during this weeks meeting was how the PCB was coming along. Our team had succesfully completed the PCB that hosts the MCU, but we are quite behind on the power board resposnible for MPPT and all of the sensing circuitry (we all have been working on midterms and interviews). Our current plan is to make the encessary changes to the MCu board before the Tuesday deadline, and try to get our second board approved as soon as possible after that. We further discussed how long shipping will take, and if it is more worth it to expedite parts on our own or order additional PCBs before the second order deadline. I believe we will need to order PCBs on our own, if we run into any issues where the PCB ordered does not work. The second item on our agenda are the revisions to the Design Document, because we did not recieve feedback at the end of our Design Review. Akshat did not have any feedback on the technical content, but would ask Profesor Schuh and respond to us tomorrow. 

# 03/05/2022 - Revisions to Design Document   <a name="designdoc"></a>
Yei and I worked on revisign the design document for most of the day. Without written feedback, we tried to ensure the formatting was concise in each section, all pictures were formatted properly, and updated the R&V's to have more detailed verification steps. We further added a section describing the lack of curtailment in the project, due to the limited amount of time to complete our project within one semester. We decided as a team that it would be very complicated to design a power supply that could autonmously switch between the solar panel voltage and an internal voltage supply. We had already begun designing two PCBs, and do not want to overextend our workload. Our system will not be extracting any power from the solar panel during no laod conditions, and the device will shut down if the load battery has fully charged. 

# 03/06/2022 - Found new paper with change of topology  <a name="designdoc"></a>

 In the resource section of this directory, there is a [MPPT Reference Design](https://github.com/kt140/ECE445_SeniorDesign/blob/main/Notebooks/Lukas/Resources/MPPT-Reference-Design.pdf "MPPT Reference Design") that I have been using to understand how the different subcircuits fit together. This docment uses an interleaved buck converter, which uses two duty cycles D1 and D2 that have a certain phase shift between them. This phase shift controls the ripple current through the inductor, where the phase delay between D1 and D2 allow for a smaller current ripple. The block diagram is shown below and each subsystem is very similar to our project, for example, 'Status and Alarms' is the LCD display, 'System Voltages' is how we plan to power the device, and the DC-DC converter is connected directly to the load. 

![](images_markdown/MMPT-block-diagram.PNG)

After looking at the advantages and disadvantages of an inter-leaved buck converter, we should meet up as a team to see if this topology is worth it to develop. The biggest concern I have is the need for 4 different PWM signals for MPPT alone. This is because eachs tage of the interleaved buck converter is its own synchronous buck converter, meaning we must also provide D1, $\bar{D1}$, D2, and  $\bar{D2}$. Reference material for interleaved buck converters can also be found in the Resources directory.

Another great thing about this reference design is the use of the INA240 Current sensor, which is an IC that measures the voltage across a shunt resistor and outputs the current. The location of these sensors on the block diagram is especially important, because we willalso need current sensors at the input and output of the MPPT Dc-DC converter. We currently have simulations and schematics drawn up for a normal buck converter, where these shunt resistors do not dissipate a lot of power. 
The image below shows how this current sensor would be used to measure the DC current output for a three pahse motor. The IC is essential an op amp that amplifies the measured current reading, and also includes enhanced PWM rejection to help eliminate any voltage ripple across the shunt resistor. The INA240 is expensive, but a few locations have them in stock and would be a good alternative to measure the current flowing through our PCB traces for the MPPT feedback algorithm.

# 03/09/2022 - Completed Transition from GitLab to GitHub  <a name="designdoc"></a>
I have been recording my progress in my own GitLab notebook, which ws shown to our TA during the first TA meeting. Since then, we noticed the course webpage was edited to allow for a GitHub account instead of the GitLab. This entry marks the first time I was successfully able to clone and merge my own repository with my teammates. I am not lsited as a contributor for the project for some reason, but installed GitBash to complete all future Push/Pull requests.

# 03/10/2022 - Team Meeting before spring break       <a name="designdoc"></a>
We met together at the Siebel basement to discuss our schedule for PCB orders. Wonjoon has done the majority of the work for the MCU PCB, but Yei and I have been very indecsive about which topology we want to use. In this meeting, we had Wonjoon give us a full summary of the PCB he designed, while making sure we were explicitly aware of any connectors or signals that needed to be connected to our MPPT Power PCB. This was to ensure that we can correctly route the PWM and feedback signals to the MCU, while separating the power traces from the small signal traces. Furthermore, we had a msicommunication between team members where there are two USB protocols necessary to complete our project. Wonjoon implemented the USB data protocol that allows us to program the MCU, but we have not developed the USB circuitry for 10 W charging. the 10W charging will need to be implemented on the power PCB, to avoid sending a 2 A signal to the MCU board. Currently, Yei and I need to double check the connectors of the Solar Panel in the ECE 445 Lab, finalize the MPPT converter, design an LDO or voltage regualtor for the internal power supply, and formulate how USB charging can be implemented. 

# 03/11/2022 - Finalizing Power Board Schematic with Yei  <a name="designdoc"></a>

After discussing the project with Yei, I realized that we would not be able to meet the Requirements & Verifications (R&V) we wrote in the Design Document without including an energy storage unit. We could not visualize a clear solution for how to simulatnaeouisly extract MPPT and regulate USB charging. It would be unsafe to use an external energy unit ( like a Lithium Ion Battery) to charge a USB device and harness the energy from the solar panel, because we would essentailly be running current directly through the battery and degrading its quality. This requires us to design some circuitry that allows the USB charger to be connected directly to the output of the MPPT DC-DC converter instead of the battery, however, we cannot gaurantee the maximum power point will be found in this sitaution. A PWM solar controller like the 
[SunKeeper](https://www.morningstarcorp.com/products/sunkeeper/ "SunKeeper") provided in lab is commonly used to charge batteries at fixed DC-DC power ratings. Despite eliminating a separate excess energy storage unit from our project, we realized that this was essential to locating the maximum power point. If we do not include this, the MPPT has an upper bound dependent on the USB load, and we may be unsuccesful in compelting the R&Vs outlined in the Design Document. This prohibted us from contiuning on with the power board, until we incorporated some way to store the excess energy with MPPT. 

# 03/12/2022 - TA Meeting and Group Planning <a name="designdoc"></a>
Due to several of our team members having interviews, we met on the first Saturday of Spring Break for our weekly TA meeting. We mainly discussed how to move forward ordering parts and ordering the PCB on our own. We ran into issues with the cost of our board being $133 for 5 copies, which caused us to miss the first PCB deaadline. Since the 3/8 deadline, we have audited the MCU board and placed an order ourselves to make sure it will arrive in time to test and debug. The biggest concern moving forward is finalizing the power board before the second deadline, and making sure all of our parts can be ordered as soon as possible. 

# 03/18/2022 - Research for USB-A Charging  <a name="designdoc"></a>

I have been using some of my freetime ovre spring break to understand how the USB-A Charging protocol will be implemented. 
At first we all thought that it would be controlled through the MCU, due to standard USB-A protocol also containing birediectional data ports. The following image is from 
["The Basics of USB Battery Charging"](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/tutorials/4/4803.html "THE BASICS OF USB BATTERY CHARGING"), which shows the four input ports for typical USB communication. 
![](images_markdown/Regular-USB-Ports.PNG)
For our project, we do not want to send any data to the USB device connected as a load, which allows us to eliminate the need for both of the data lines D+ and D-. This can be done by connecting the D+ and D- lines together via a resistor. The resistance must be R $\leq 200 \ \Omega$, and this mode is referred to as a Designated Charging Port (DCP). A clear illustration of this is given Figure 10 of the [TPS2514 DATASHEET](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps2513.pdf?ts=1647718862163&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FTPS2513 "TPS2514 DATASHEET"). 

![](images_markdown/DCP-short-mode.PNG)

This allows the device to bypass the USB communication protocol, and directly connect to the internal battery. We can further ensure that the external USB device is recieving the correct power, by manipulating the voltage potential on either of the D- or D+ lines. The Divider 2 charging scheme is used for
10-W adapters, and applies 2.7 V on the D+ line and 2 V is applied on the D‚Äì line, as show below. Fortunately, the TPS2513 is in stock on [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/TPS2513ADBVR/4494483#mktPlaceViewSection "Digikey"), and configures these two lines for us. This drastically simplifies the amount of work required to configure the USB port, where the TPS2513 automatically detects the power requirement of the input usb port. This further matches the simple Female USB connectors available [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/BOB-12700/5762450?utm_adgroup=Adapter%2C%20Breakout%20Boards&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Shopping_Product_Prototyping%2C%20Fabrication%20Products&utm_term=&utm_content=Adapter%2C%20Breakout%20Boards&gclid=CjwKCAjw_tWRBhAwEiwALxFPobpQSucNdZ-V3F0eN1F23PQx7BZaxLHDijavc5yAr-V-B6fmEHjo6BoCjKIQAvD_BwE "here").



![](images_markdown/DCP-10W.PNG)


![](images_markdown/Ideal-DCP-config.PNG)

If this does not work, there is also the option of buying a premade board to do this for us, and simply interface [this board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Lipo-Rider-Plus-p-4204.html?gclid=CjwKCAjw_tWRBhAwEiwALxFPoR--l6bB3jGPfZKoGkSbGB3EaNlgAs9KFKoq4bSAiMn4nbsBqeK3YBoCO0kQAvD_BwE "this board") with MPPT. 

# 03/25/2022 - TA meeting and Team Meeting  <a name="designdoc"></a>

The first round of parts being ordered were delivered this week, but we have not recieved our MCU board to begin assembly and testing. This board is scheduled to arrive over the weekend, right before the second PCB order deadline. The focus of the TA meeting (3:45 PM) was to ensure we were designing our PCBs according to course standards, similar to the material covered during the PCB design review. With the second deadline being shortly after spring break, and our team being behind for several personal reasons, we talked about each aspect of the power PCB board that were not finalized. This included, the placement of current sensors, discussion of replacement parts, clearance for heat sinks, and USB charging safety. Although we have schematics for these designed in the KiCad schematic editor, we have not been able to simulate the MPPT fucntionality, which made us fall behind in the PCB routing and external connections. 

After a few hours of independent work, we also had a team meeting at 8 PM to discuss what each team member could focus on. Wonjoon would focus on the MCU code and assembly of the MCU board once it is delivered, whereas Yei and I will do all we can to make sure the power board PCB will not have to be ordered a second time. We further discussed the lack of components in stock on major carriers like digikey, suggesting to use breakout boards for safe USB charging and UART conversion. This is the easiest way for us to proceed in the project, without having extra safety concerns when testing. 


# 03/27/2022 - Worked with Kanin to finish Schematics  <a name="designdoc"></a>

With the second order PCB deadline around the corner, Kanin and I have been developing different parts of our PCB part. Previously, we were working in different KiCad Schematics, each downloading the ECAD file from Mouser as we each selected different parts. I had looked over the parts needed for the USB 10 W charging subsytem, as well as the current sensor ICs which had signals that needed to be routed to the MCU board. Today, we met up at ECEB to generate a bill of materials for the parts we needed to order and incorporated all of our schematics into a single KiCad Project. This was a tedious process, and involved both o fus scrolling through Mouser and Digikey to find the necessary model files and importing them to KiCad through the Library Loader application. we chose to move the USB charging module and closed loop feedback units into Kanin's working project, because he would take charge of the routing. The final implementation for version 1 can be seen below, which has been delayed due to a lack of supply and our team being behind on the project.

# 03/28/2022 - Routing and Ordering parts <a name="designdoc"></a>
After all of the parts were in a skingle KiCad Project, we could begind defining the outline of th epower board as well as the different layers. We chose to use a 2 layer board for this application, because the large power traces must have certain amount of  clearance. We are estimating the maximum current to be around 4 A as a worst case scenario, so our power traces are mostly between 70-100 mils. Kanin finished most of the routing on his own, but we were both on a zoom call as I tried to help give ideas and look at trace clearance. When Kanin and I were ot working on the KiCad file together, I was finalizing the bill of materials. THe INA240 Current Sensors that are used in PWM systems only had 10 in stock on Mouser, so i quickly purchased them on my own. This allowed us to ensure the part would be in stocl, due to it taking a few days for orders to be processed through myECE. Kanin later palced this order, after this board was approved for the second round audit.

# 04/02/2022 - Panic About Shipping delay + MCU programming <a name="designdoc"></a>
After the second PCB round order, all of our team spent some time working on the individual progress report and then focused on other classes. The PCB for our MCU arrive on 3/31, and all of the parts had been delievred to the senior design lab. We wanted to begin building this board right away, but the MCU board was delivered to Wonjoon while he was in quarantine for COVID. What makes this situation worse is that DHL, the shipping company for Version 2 of the Power board PCB, has an expected arrival date of 4/22. We paid expedited shipping on both baords, but DHL has had extremely long shipping delays for us. I do not know if this is because some of our PCBs were ordered through JLC, but this happened for both of our orders. We will contact the shipping company once our package is in the United States, hopefully it will arrive on time. 

I have begun looking into the MCU programming, specifically, how we can assign values to each of the different hardware pins and how each signal will be extened over each board. Wonjoon has sent a few articles over about how we will program the Atmega328P using the Arduino IDE. We are essentially using a development board that has a UART IC on it, because there are no more parts available online.  

# 04/07/2022 - Power Board PCB Arrives <a name="designdoc"></a>
Fortunately, the power board PCB made it to the U.S. faster then anticiapted, and we were able to contact DHL for our package. The power baord was delivered to Kanin this afternoon, I had recieved a shipment from Mouser yesterday, and we had our previous part orders sitting in our locker in the senior design lab. We are now trying to get into the lab as soon as possible, to begin assembling the power board. Our plan is to solder the small ICs and SMD components under the microscope first, and then I can complete any larger components at home with my personal soldering iron. 


Furthermore, Wonjoon is now out of quarantine and has been assembling the MCU PC. We are trying to coordinate when we can both be in the lab to test the MCU for programmability, and to test the ATMEGA328P duty cycle signals.
